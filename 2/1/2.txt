nowadaysd, the issue of people want to be a famous sportsman has become more than just obvious, from thinking about the rich life to the imagination of admiration. Some people claim tha this reflects a hard training problem. Personally, I think it is not a good idea.

Admittedly, sportsman is very popular so perple also want a rich life. First of all, money will be rewarded when a player won a game, because people will use money on tickets and wifi to watch it online, because people want to watch other players playing,.

Moreover, regarding private life, this is a paradise for just relax and do nothing, but it is all wrong. It is actually traning all day long except someone is shooting because sportspeople need to make others think they are just so good at sport.

However, focusing soly on the lifestyle may be too simplistic. While considering the life, we must also consider famous sportsman be like when a quick match is comming on, which shows the broader significance of people want to be a sportsman or not. People will get stressed when a unexpect thing just occured.  As it's knowned to all, retirement means no more place to earn money.

Addressing the issue of people want to be a sportsman or not is a cooperative effort for both lifestyle and the stress, with certain priority roles to perform respectively. In this regard, I would believe that it is still not a good idea.
