Nowadays, the issue of the effect on the choise teenagers make has become more than just obvious, from friends to parents. Some people claims that this reflects a fqact that people can not do what they really want, because of the affect of other people. Personally, I think it is a sophisticated thing to say.

Admittedly, people will always copy people arround them to make sure they are not the black horse in a white horse saddle. first of all, friends will be the most effect person to people, because most of their are in the same age as them.

Moreover, regarding parents, it will take more time to let people take options unless they explains why. Since people will think it maybe old fashion way to solve a problem, parents should expain what they said is wright so people will make choise with plausible thing that their parents said.

However, focusing solely on people affection may be too simplistic. While thinking about people's effect, people must also consider the online effect, witch shows the broader significance of the effect on choise teenagers make. Online videos will also effect the method of speaking like rizz. As it known to all, the effect of speaking will make a possibility of saying the imformal words in a formal event.

Addressing the issue of the choise teengers do is a cooperative effort for both real life and online contents, with certain priority roles to perform respectively. In this regard, I whould believe that friends have the most effect on discisions making.
