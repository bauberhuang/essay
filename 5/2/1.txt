School Trips

In today's fast paced world, a lot of people think that go on a school trip is a excellent idea, but also a huge amount of people possess the opposite idea. In this essay, I will use essencial topics to choose who is right in my opinion.
First, learning new things
A school trip means they will only go to historical or educational places or a very low percentage on going to a place just for fun.so most of the time at a school trip, you will be given tasks to complete. For example: 'Ask a worker how do calculators work' or 'write down all the information on your note.'. In my opinion, you just changed another place to study, but you are learning the place where you are standing at that time. It means that all the students are studying during a school trip.
Second, missing school lessons
if you have a trip in school time, there is no doubt that you will miss a day of studying at school, it will be severe if the trip had been declared to be a long time. However, it is possible that you can go to a school trip where you learn more about the knowledge that you are learning at the time what you are studying, and we totally be allowed to finish a chapter and then we will have time that is not been affected. all the school need is to make sure it matches what the students are learning.
Last, difficulty on the school's side
for the school's point of view, they has to book a majority of tickets , it's possible to not buy tickets if we can walk to there without using so much energy. In addition, they has to tell the students' parents by a letter, and then they need to make sure all the acceptations and disagreement, then they are going to make a group and show it to students and so on. So it will be very rare to go to a school trip.Since it is very tough.
Finally, I would like to summarize my opinion
You are studying in a school trips, you are learning during a school trip if school connects textbook and trip, and it is very rare.
