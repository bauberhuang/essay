School Trips

In today's fast-paced world, many people think that going on a school trip is an excellent idea, but a huge number of people hold the opposite opinion. In this essay, I will discuss essential topics to explain who I believe is right.
Firstly, learning new things.
A school trip usually means students will visit historical or educational places, and it is scarce for them to go somewhere just for fun. Therefore, most of the time on a school trip, you will be given tasks to complete. For example: You might be asked to ask a worker how calculators work or to write down all the information in your notebook. In my opinion, you are simply studying in a different place, but you are learning about the place where you are visiting. It means that all the students are studying during a school trip.
Secondly, missing school lessonsã€‚
If you go on a trip during school time, there is no doubt that you will miss a day of studying, it will be severe if the trip had been declared to be a long time. However, you can go on a school trip where you learn more about the knowledge that you are learning at the time you are studying, and you be allowed to finish a chapter and then you will have time that is not been affected. All the school needs is to make sure it matches what the students are learning.
Lastly, difficulty on the school's side.
From the school's point of view, they have to book most of the tickets, it's possible to not buy tickets if we can walk there without using so much energy. In addition, they have to tell the student's parents by a letter, and then they need to make sure all the acceptations and disagreements, then they are going to form a group and show it to students and so on. So it will be very rare to go on a school trip. Since it is very tough.
Finally, I would like to summarize my opinion.
You are studying on a school trip, you are learning during a school trip if the school connects textbook and trip, and it is very infrequent.
