School Trips
In today's fast-paced world, many people think that going on a school trip is an excellent idea, but a large number of people hold the opposite opinion. In this essay, I will discuss important topics to explain who I believe is right.
Firstly, Learning new things.
School trips allow students to learn new things. A school trip usually involves visiting historical or educational places. Most of the time on a school trip, students are given tasks to complete.  In my opinion, students are still studying and gaining knowledge about the places they visit.
Secondly, missing school lessons.
Missing school lessons can be a serious issue, especially if the trip lasts for a long time. However, Schools just need to make sure that the trip content matches the curriculum.
Thirdly, from the school's point of view
From the schoolâ€™s point of view, they have to book most of the tickets and so on.  Therefore, it is rare for schools to organize trips.
In conclusion, students continue learning during school trips, especially when the school connects the trip to the textbook content. However, organizing such trips is challenging, so they are rare.
