                                     School Trips
In today's fast paced world, a lot of people thinks that go on a school trip is a excellent idea, but also a huge amount of people possess the opposite idea. In this essay, I will use essencial topics to choose who is wright in my opinion.
First, learning new things
In a school trip means they will go to historical or educational places or a very lo percentage on getting a trip just for fun.so most of the time at a school trip, you will be given tasks to complete. For example: 'Ask a worker how do calculators works' or 'search all the information on your note.'. In my opinion, you just changed another place to study, but you are learning the place where you are standing. It means that all the students are studying during a school trip.
Second, missing school lessons
if you have a trip in school time, there is no doubt that you will miss a day of studying, it will be severe if the trip had been declared to be a long time. However, it is possible that you can go to a school trip where you learn more about the knowledge that you are learning at that time, and we can just finish a chapter totally and then we will have time that is not been affected. all the school need is to make sure it matches what the students are learning.
Last, difficulty on the school's side
for the school's point of view, they has to book a majority of tickets or it's possible to walk there. In addition, they has to tell the students' parents by a letter, and then they need to make sure all the acceptations and disagreement, then they are going to make a group and show it to students and so on. So it will be very rare to go to a school trip.
Finally, I would like to summarize my opinion
You are studying in a school trips, you are learning during a school trip if school connects textbook and trip, and it is very rare.
