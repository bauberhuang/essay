School Trips

In today's fast-paced world, many people think that going on a school trip is an excellent idea, but some people don't think so. In this essay, I will explain why I believe it is a great idea.

Firstly, learning new content. A school trip usually will only visit historical or educational places, and it is scarce just for fun. Therefore, most of the students need to complete tasks like asking a worker how the calculator works or writing in a notebook. In my opinion, they are visiting and studying a place at the same time, which means they are studying during a school trip.

Secondly, missing school lessons. Having a school tour at school times will indeed miss school lessons, it can be serious when the time is long. However, The students are allowed to learn where they are, the school needs to match the curriculum.

Lastly, difficulty on the school's side. From the school's point of view, they need to book tickets, inform parents, form groups and so on. So it will be very rare to go on a school trip.

So the students can not only study historical facts but also learn textbooks during a school trip. But please note that any kind of school trip is very infrequent.
