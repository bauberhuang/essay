School Trips

In today's fast-paced world, many people think that going on a school trip is an excellent idea, whereas others disagree. In this essay, I will explain why I believe it is a great idea.

Firstly, learning fresh knowledge. A school trip usually visits historical or educational places, while it is scarce just for fun. Therefore, most of the students need to complete tasks like asking a worker how the calculator works or writing in a notebook -- apparently, they are visiting and studying a place at the same time.

Secondly, missing school lessons. Having a school tour at school times will indeed miss school lessons, it can be serious if the trip lasts too long. However, the students are allowed to learn where they are, the school needs to match the curriculum.

Lastly, difficulty on the school's side. From the school's point of view, they need to book tickets, inform parents, form groups, etc. So it will be very rare to go on a school trip.

Thus, the students can not only study sophisticated historical facts but also learn textbooks during a school trip. But please note that any kind of school trip is very infrequent, which is undeniable, and indispensable.
