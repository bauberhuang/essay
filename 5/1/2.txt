Hi Emily,
I hope you had a good day!
I am surprised that you intend to learn Chinese Manderin -- my mother language, this is absolutely tough to learn. But here are some tips that might helps you!
Firstly, Chinese easy learning trick. There are suffix in chinese, just like the alphabet in English. In addition, you also allowed to use English words to mitigate your stress. For instance, you will find mango in English with the same pronounciation in Chinese.
Secondly, the tough parts.  There are 100 words in only one pronounciation, which is inveitable. There is also a problem that you might swear someone without realizing. For instance, if you said mom but in the old-fashoned way, it would means that listener is not brave enough.
Lastly, need a tutor or not. If you had goals that your Chinese needs to be useful or be a Chinese tutor, you need a tutor to make this language proffesional. In my own opnion , if it is not what you want, you can just proctice and learn some grammars.
You can talk to ChatGPT for 30 minutes every day, you will will have unexpected improvement!
Yours,
Tom
