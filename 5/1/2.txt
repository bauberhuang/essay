Hi Emily,
I hope you had a good day!
Do you know that you just possessed the biggest surprise I could ever imagine! I will be extremely dumbfounded if you just mastered Chinese ,it is absolutely tough to learn.  But here are some tips may helps you!
First, the easy parts.
Learning the hardest language is a very tough time, but there are facts like suffix that are allowed to help you. for instance, the gold suffix, heart suffix and so on. these can also be one of the letters.it can reduce half of your stress. There are some tricks that you have permission to literally use English to learn Chinese, like the coffee word and mango.
Second, the tough parts.
there are hundreds of letters in only one pronunciation ,so you need to understand them, write them, use them. However, you don't need to recite all of them by the way. You will face old-fashioned words became swear words, so be aware on that, I will help you on this problem. For instance, the word mom's old Chinese word means "so girlish, afraid to do any thing".
third, need a tutor or not.
If you have goals that it needs to be useful or be a Chinese tutor , you need a tutor to make this language proffesional.In my own opnion, it increase a higher persentage to a better college, it allows you to be had a talent on that.But if you just want to talk to Chinese like me and travel to China, a chinese learning book is enough.
My seceret advice is to talk to ChatGPT in Chinese for 30min each day, and your Chinese will be fluent.
Yours,
Tom
