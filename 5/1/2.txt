Hi Emily,
I hope you had a great day!
I am surprised that you intend to learn Chinese Mandarin, which is my mother language, this is definitely tough to learn. But here are some tips that might help you!
Firstly, here are some easy tricks for learning Chinese. There are some components in Chinese characters, similar to how the alphabet forms words in English. In addition, you are also allowed to use English words to loosen your stress. For example, you will find mango in English has got the similar pronunciation in Chinese.
Secondly, the tough parts. There are a lot of words in only one pronunciation, which is inevitable. There is also a problem that you might swear at someone without realizing. For instance, if you said mom but in the old-fashioned way, it would mean that the listener is not brave enough.
Lastly, is it nessary to hire a tutor. If you have goals that your Chinese needs to be useful or be a Chinese tutor, you need a teacher to professionalize your Chinese skill. In my own opinion, if it is not what you want, you can just practice and learn some grammar.
You can talk to ChatGPT for 30 minutes every day, you will have unexpected improvement!
Yours,
Tom
