Nowadays,the emphasis of issue of health has become more than just obvious,from social media to diverse new product ads. Some people claim that schools have the responsibility to guide students all the knowledge about healthy living. Personally, I think schoolsplay a certain rolein the education of health, but not all.

Admittedly, schools are account for a certain part of guidance for children as they spend most of their education there. First of all, schools conduct exercise classes and sports activities for students .Exercise is very essential part of keeping fit and we can't really guarantee daily exercises if it's according to our will. It is schools that make it compulsion for students, so it will actually benefit them a lot.Moreover, regarding food, most of the schools make a strict rule andfollow a balanced dietforfood in cafeteria, which will also enrich students'health with required nutrients.

However, we can’t put all the responsibility on school.Though the education in school involves a wide range,it mostly prioritizes in academic subjects study. Children spend majority of time with their parents, which makes sense to say, family education perform a major role in children’s healthy growing. Parents need to perform a role model to create a healthy living atmosphere for their children. As it’s known to all,good life habits will influence children into their adulthood.

Education is a cooperative effort for both schools and families, andwith a certain priority role to perform respectively.In this regard, I would believe healthy life concepts are guided through school and family together.
