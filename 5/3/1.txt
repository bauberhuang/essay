Throw things
In today's fast-paced world, many people think we throw away too many things, while others possess the opposite. In this essay, I will explain why I think the fact is true.

Firstly, throwing food or leftovers will lead to an energy-wasting problem. It will be an indispensable thing that we need to focus on. Unless food is expired, we have to eat it.

Secondly, throwing clothes not only means a new fashion has started but also means a new recycling. However, it is not necessary to throw clothes and buy clothes but different patterns.

Lastly, Throwing books is the same thing as throwing clothes. We do not need to always throw a lot of books even if we are finished. We can revise this undeniable hard knowledge.

Thus, it would be less energy waste and less recycling if people decided not to throw things away.
