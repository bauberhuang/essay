Nowadays, the emphasis of issue of wasting things has become more than just obvious, from throwing away unusable things to wasting things. Some people claim that it is a severe problem to waste usable things. Personally, it allows humans to possess a convenient way to finish things they do not need to use, but not all. 

Admittedly, there are many things that are unforgivable to waste. For example, food. We need to stop wasting food as it is a very bad thing to do while some people are not allowed to eat fully. It is needed to get noticed and make sure to stop this kind of things.

However, there are also a lot of things that we need to throw out. For instance, clothes. If your clothes are small, or your clothes have a big hole, you should throw them unless you want to make a pest kingdom. If you keep don't throwing it away, your house's usable space will reduce in a blink of an eye.

However, we also need to throw away expired food and keep brand-new clothes. It lead to a sentence that you need to think separately.
