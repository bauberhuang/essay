<Admittedly, wasting unusable things are account for a certain part of guidance for energy as most of them has got the most energy. 
First of all, wasting usable things conduct recycling. Recycling is very essential parts for keeping most of the powers usable and we can't guarantee daily recycling if it is according to our will. 
It is the recycling place that make compultion for people, so it will benefit them a lot.
Moreover, reguarding clothes wasting, most of them are alllowed to get recycled and it would be serious if we do not wear them or throw them away.


However, we can't put all responsibility on recycling place. Though the machine in that place involves huge ammount of space, but some of those unusable thing might spend a majority of time on us, like books, which make sence to say, knowledge perform a important role in human's growing.


Wasting problem is a cooperative effort for both recycling place and people, and with a certain priority role to perform respectively. In this reguard, I would believe wasting problems concepts are guided from recycling place and everyone.
